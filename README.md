### Script 1 - software.sh

This script automates the installation of the following software:

- Docker
- Google Chrome
- Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Python

### Functionality

1. The script checks for an internet connection and exits if there is no internet connection.
2. The script updates the package index, upgrades system packages, and installs Linux build essential and headers.
3. The script prompts the user to choose which software packages to install. If the user chooses to install a package, the script installs it using the appropriate package manager. If the package is already installed, the script skips the installation process.
4. The script updates the package index and upgrades system packages again, and prints "Installation complete!" to indicate that the installation process is finished.

### Script 2 - extensions.sh

This script automates the installation of the following Visual Studio Code extensions:

- Python
- Shellman
- Docker
- Intellicode

### Functionality

1. The script checks for an internet connection and exits if there is no internet connection.
2. The script checks if Visual Studio Code is installed and exits if it isn't.
3. The script prompts the user to confirm if they want to proceed with the installation of the extensions. If the user confirms, the script proceeds to install each of the extensions, prompting the user for confirmation for each extension.
4. If an extension is already installed, the script skips the installation of that extension.
5. Once all the extensions have been installed or skipped, the script prints a message indicating the completion of the installation process.
