### Script 1 - software.sh

This script automates the installation of the following software:

- Google Chrome
- Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Docker
- Python
- Node.js
- VirtualBox
- VLC
- Notepadqq

### Functionality

1. The script creates two log files. A file named `install.log` that will register all the commands executed by the script and a file named `error.log` that will register every error that occurs while executing the script.
2. The script checks for an internet connection and exits if there is no internet connection.
3. The script checks if the user running the script is root or has sudo privileges and exits if it isn't.
4. The script updates the package index, upgrades system packages and refreshes snap packages.
5. The script prompts the user to choose which software to install. If the user chooses to install a software, the script installs it. If the package is already installed, the script says so.
6. The script prompts the user to choose if they want to delete the log files created by the script.

### Script 2 - extensions.sh

This script automates the installation of the following Visual Studio Code extensions:

- Python
- Shellman
- Docker
- Intellicode
- Node.js extension pack 

### Functionality

1. The script creates two log files. A file named `extensions-install.log` that will register all the commands executed by the script and a file named `extensions-error.log` that will register every error that occurs while executing the script.
2. The script checks for an internet connection and exits if there is no internet connection.
3. The script checks if the VS Code installed in the device and exits if it isn't.
4. The script prompts the user to choose which extensions to install. If the user chooses to install a extension, the script installs it. If the package is already installed, the script says so.
6. The script prompts the user to choose if they want to delete the log files created by the script.
